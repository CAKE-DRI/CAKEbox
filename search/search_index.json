Experiences showed that this can help committees focus their efforts, understand why some initiatives succeed or fail, and identify realistic next steps.</p> <p>Training is effective when delivered at all levels of an organisation, which makes sure everyone is equipped with the toolkit to challenge things that aren't right. </p> <p>Improving EDI at events &amp; securing funding to do so:</p> <p>This is successful when EDI is intentionally built into planning and funding. Some highlighted successful practices were: offering bursaries, childcare and carer support, and visa funding to reduce hidden participation costs.</p> <p>The group noted that accessibility and inclusion measures are often treated as optional extras, particularly when funding is limited or reliant on sponsorship. There was agreement that inclusion costs should be built into grant budgets and supported by funders as standard practice. Clarity from UKRI on what can be funded for accessibility and inclusion was identified as a key action point.</p> <p>The group identified an opportunity to raise this to stakeholders, the communtiy and UKRI at the upcoming DRI congress. CAKE will be hosting a knowledge-exchange-focussed session that could progress this discussion.  </p> <p>It was also recognised that conferences and research events are essential working environments and should therefore meet the same accessibility expectations as office spaces.</p> <p>Capturing impact and evidence: </p> <p>The discussion highlighted the importance of collecting evidence and case studies, both where things were successful and those that did not work as intended. Capturing this will help the group learn from existing work and focus on impactful, evidence-based action.

There was recognition that while both areas are important, there is still a lack of clarity about where and how this group can have the greatest impact. Members discussed how individuals from underrepresented groups should not carry the burden of driving change and responsibility should lie with those in positions of power to enable lasting progress. It was acknowledged that significant structural barriers continue to limit diversity in leadership. </p> <p>There was consensus that while structural barriers continue to limit diversity in leadership, existing best-practice materials should be built upon rather than duplicated. Creating concise, accessible guidance tailored to the group\u2019s communities was seen as valuable and a good way to build upon existing materials.</p> <p>The group also noted the need to draw from existing investments and resources (e.g. national EDI initiatives), collect case studies of successes and challenges, and establish a clear statement of purpose.</p> <p>Proposing next steps for the group</p> <p>Based on the survey results, a plan was proposed on how to structure the group and what steps should be taken next: </p> <ul> <li>Collect \u2192 Case studies, existing resources, guidance from UKRI, how to measure impact </li> <li>Build \u2192 Distill our collection down into best practice guidance for our communities </li> <li>Deliver \u2192 Present findings at key events, publish resources, distill into a clear action plan. <ul> <li>These steps are not exclusive, and expect these to be done in parallel to iteratively grow and respond to community feedback/needs. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The group discussed how to ensure that best practices genuinely address the needs of the community and reflect a broad range of perspectives. Collecting case studies was seen as a valuable way to test assumptions, identify gaps, and ensure existing policies and procedures align with lived experiences. There was a suggestion that the group should explore collaboration with social scientists and consider ethical aspects.</p> <p>It was noted that levels of diversity vary across communities, and targeted efforts may be needed to reach those that are less engaged or face persistent barriers. As well as this, members highlighted the importance of maintaining a clear and manageable scope, focusing primarily on computational research communities, while ensuring the work remains practical and implementable. </p> <p>There was interest in pursuing small, measurable, and scalable actions\u2014for example, inclusive event training or improving recruitment outreach to diverse networks \u2014 while also recognising the risk of focusing only on actions that benefit the majority. The group agreed that both local, high-impact initiatives and longer-term structural change are needed to create meaningful progress.</p> <p>Date of Next Meeting (DONM): 12/12/2025, 10am, Online via Teams</p> <p>(please contact cake-management@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk for any queries about these minutes)cd</p>"},{"location":"working-groups/edi/minutes/25-12-12/","title":"12/12/2025","text":""},{"location":"working-groups/edi/minutes/25-12-12/#agenda","title":"Agenda","text":"<ol> <li>Review of Actions</li> <li>Main Discussion:<ul> <li>Purpose, objectives and scope are defined in the Terms of Reference.</li> <li>Overview of discussion from previous meeting</li> <li>Confirm proposed work areas for group going forward</li> </ul> </li> <li>Any other business </li> </ol>"},{"location":"working-groups/edi/minutes/25-12-12/#minutes","title":"Minutes","text":""},{"location":"working-groups/edi/minutes/25-12-12/#actions","title":"Actions","text":""},{"location":"working-groups/edi/minutes/25-12-12/#main-discussion","title":"Main discussion","text":"<p>Proposal for next steps: </p> <ul> <li>Collect case studies from the community </li> <li>Collect existing resources </li> <li>Liaise with UKRI for guidance around funding </li> <li>Learn/Collect best practice for measuring impact of EDIA initiatives. </li> </ul> <p>Using all of this existing material and expertise to distill best practices/action plans that are tailored for the specific communities within this working group\u2019s scope to improve EDIA in all areas.</p> <p>Purpose, objectives and scope are defined in the Terms of Reference.
