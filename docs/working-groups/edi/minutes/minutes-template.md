!!! question "Public Summary of Minutes Template" 

    In order to encourage transparency and to build a group that benefits the wider community, we share summarised versions of our meeting minutes on the CAKE-CoSeC EDI Working Group public website.

    When preparing these summaries, please ensure discussions are anonymised - providing a high-level overview of topics and actions but removing individual names or group-specific details.
