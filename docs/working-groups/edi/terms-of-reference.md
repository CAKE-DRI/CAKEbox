# CAKE-CoSeC EDI Working Group Terms of Reference

This document outlines the terms of reference for the organisation and delivery of an equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) working group collaboration between the [Computational Abilities Knowledge Exchange](https://cake-dri.github.io/) (CAKE) and [Computational Science Centre for Research Communities](https://www.cosec.ac.uk/) (CoSeC) projects.

## Purpose 
To promote and support a culture of EDI across the UK Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI), specifically communities engaging with CoSeC and CAKE activities, by delivering tangible, community-driven actions and offering strategic advice on inclusive practices in communication, recruitment, research, training, and event organisation.

## Definitions 
### Equality
Fairness in treatment and access to opportunity: we must ensure that individuals, or groups of individuals, are not treated less favourably because of their protected characteristics, as defined under the Equality Act 2010. 

### Diversity
Recognition, respect and celebration of differences in background, identity and experience. A diverse environment is one with a wide range of backgrounds and mindsets.

### Inclusion 
Creating spaces where all individuals feel welcomed, respected and valued. Inclusion involves awareness of unconscious bias and intentional actions to remove exclusionary practices.

## Objectives 
The CAKE-CoSeC EDI working group will work to embed equality, diversity and inclusion across all CAKE and CoSeC activities by: 
* Collecting, developing, and disseminating best practices for EDI across all operational areas including communication, recruitment, research, training, and event organisation.
* Representing diverse voices, with a focus on acknowledging and responding to their varying needs and contexts.
* Identifying barriers to inclusion and developing actionable strategies to address them.
* Recommending actions to CAKE, CoSeC and other stakeholders to support meaningful, measurable outcomes.
* Liaise with other EDI groups and initiatives in the community and adjacent communities to exchange notes, best practices, and share material. For example: EDI Working Group of the Society for Research Software Engineering, Women in HPC, DiveRSE.

## Scope
The CAKE-CoSeC EDI working group’s scope includes:
* CAKE-related activities, with a focus on knowledge exchange across UK DRI, collaboration, and delivery of CAKE’s EDI objectives.
* CoSeC-related activities, including those of the Collaborative Computational Projects (CCPs) and High-End Computing (HEC) communities supported by CoSeC.

The group will focus on practical, community-driven initiatives while aligning with the broader [EDI guidance from UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/manage-your-award/good-research-resource-hub/guidance-for-equality-diversity-and-inclusion/). It will not duplicate existing policy work but will instead apply and contextualise it to meet the specific needs of CAKE, CoSeC, and related communities.

## Roles and Responsibilities 
The CAKE-CoSeC EDI working group consists of Chair(s) and Members. To encourage shared responsibility and collaborative leadership, the group aims to be governed by two Chairs with rotating roles.
