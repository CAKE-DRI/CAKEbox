title: Communications & Outreach
tags: [Central themes, Communications & Outreach]
---

Effective communication is vital to knowledge exchange. This applies both to how we communicate with others in our community to foster strong, productive collaborations, and to how we engage external audiences to share our work more widely. Thoughtful and strategic communication can increase engagement, strengthen partnerships, attract funding opportunities, and spark new collaborations with communities you may not have previously connected with.

<!-- The outreach community in computational science is wide reaching, and can mean many things; connecting with pre-schoolers, university students, general public, and can mean many different venues; science fairs, lectures, papers. -->

This theme brings together guidance, templates and examples that support researchers and practitioners to share their work clearly, effectively and impactfully with different audiences.
