Welcome to the page for the CAKE-CoSeC Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Working Group. 

This is a collaborative initiative between CAKE and [Computational Science Centre for Research Communities (CoSeC)](https://www.cosec.ac.uk), to promote and support a culture of EDI across the UK DRI landscape. Our purpose is to deliver tangible, community-driven actions and offering strategic advice on inclusive practices in areas such as communication, recruitment, research, training, and event organisation.
