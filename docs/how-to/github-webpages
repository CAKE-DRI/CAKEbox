# Very high level to alter something on a github.io webpage

This guide provides some very high-level instructions of how to make changes to github.io webpages using only the browser.
Most people will prefer to use git access directly, but sometimes a quick change through the web is what you want.
The CAKEbox is using this technology, but also [CAKE itself](https://cake.ac.uk) or [SHAREing](https://shareing-dri.github.io/).
