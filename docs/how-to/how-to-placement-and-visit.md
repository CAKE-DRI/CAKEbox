# Best Practice Guidance for Successful CAKE Placements & Visits

## Introduction: 
This guidance is intended to support both applicants and hosts in achieving successful placements and visits funded by the CAKE Placements and Visits Programme. These opportunities are designed to facilitate meaningful knowledge exchange across disciplines and institutions, and to help establish or strengthen sustainable long-term collaborations within the UK Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) community. 

We define a successful placement and visit as one that: 

* Has clearly defined goals that prioritise the sharing of knowledge, skills, tools or practices, 
* Fosters lasting connections and the potential for future collaborations, 
* Is inclusive, respectful and mutually beneficial for all involved.

Whether you are experienced in professional placements and visits, a new PhD student, exploring a new direction in your career, or anywhere in between, these best practices are here to help guide you into making the most of this opportunity - from planning through to building longer-term connections. 

## General guidance: 
These general principles apply throughout all CAKE placements and visits to support a respectful, inclusive and productive environment for everyone. 

* Use respectful, inclusive and professional language in all communications. 
* Embrace the knowledge exchange nature of these opportunities: be open to learning, asking questions and sharing your own expertise. 
* Be mindful of cultural differences, disciplinary backgrounds and varying levels of experience. 
* Clearly communicate logistics and expectations to set clear boundaries for everyone. 

All engaged in the CAKE network must abide by the [CAKE Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md), ensuring a supportive and respectful environment for everyone involved.

### In-Person and Virtual Placements
The CAKE Placements and Visits Programme is open to both in-person and virtual placements. Regardless of format, placements and visits should be structured, purposeful, and include dedicated time for meaningful collaboration. Virtual engagements are expected to offer the same level of planning and intent as in-person experiences.

## Before submitting your Expression of Interest form 

* Collaborate in setting clear objectives: What do you want to achieve? What knowledge will be shared, learned or developed? 
* Be open to refining these objectives so they align with all collaborators and foster a mutually beneficial placement or visit. 
* Use this to explore how you might work together - communication and alignment on future goals is key to long-term collaboration! 
* Reflect on the future: Do your broader goals align? How might this collaboration continue and bring lasting value beyond the funding period? 


## In preparation for your placement or visit 
### For the applicant: 

* For in-person visits: plan logistics early - reach out to CAKE if you need support. 
    * Check with the host for local events, workshops and training opportunities. Can you make the most of your travel by attending multiple things?
* Share any access or support needs with your hosts (e.g. travel, accessibility, working hours, childcare, or other considerations)
* For virtual visits: coordinate with your institution to protect the time needed for the visit to be effective.

### For the host: 

* Take care to create a structured programme both for and beyond the core work. 
    * This could include introductions, meetings, shadowing or even opportunities to present themselves and their work at your organisation. 
* Be open and responsive to inclusivity needs such as wheelchair access, caring responsibilities, or flexible scheduling. 
* Clearly communicate practical expectations in advance:
    * When and where should participants be present?
    * Will there be shared breaks or informal chats?
    * Are expectations consistent throughout the visit? 
    * If applicable, is there a dress code or any preparation required?

Clarity on these small details can help reduce anxiety and ensure participants feel welcomed and informed.


## During your placement or visit 
This is the heart of your CAKE experience: when ideas are exchanged, skills are developed, and collaborations are strengthened. Whether in-person or virtual, the aim is to create a mutually beneficial, engaging, and productive environment for all involved.

* Stay connected and aligned: 
    * Schedule regular check-ins with your host or collaborator to review progress, reflect on what’s working, and address any challenges early. This ensures that the placement remains relevant and valuable to everyone.
    * Adapt if needed — goals may evolve once the work begins, and small adjustments can make the experience more productive.
* Build supportive relationships: 
    * Identify a mentor, ideally someone not directly supervising your day-to-day work, who can provide impartial advice, encouragement, and pastoral support. A mentor who remains a contact after the placement can help sustain the collaboration.
    * Engage beyond the core project where possible, such as joining team meetings, attending seminars, or exploring related initiatives within the host organisation.
* Document your experience through meeting notes, reflections, or collaborative tools. This can be formal (e.g. blog posts, knowledge summaries) or informal (e.g. shared documents), but should aim to capture key insights and resources for future use.
* Be proactive in sharing your expertise — remember, this is a two-way knowledge exchange. Offer your perspectives, approaches, and tools, even if they seem routine to you.
* Check in about accessibility and support needs regularly — circumstances may change over the course of the placement.
* Respect different working styles and time zones if working across regions or institutions.
* Plan for what comes next: 
    * As you approach the end of the placement, discuss next steps for collaboration.
    * Explore opportunities to co-develop outputs, continue skill-sharing, or plan future joint initiatives.
    * Keep in mind that the most successful collaborations often grow well beyond the initial funded period.


## After your placement or visit 
Your CAKE placement or visit may be complete, but the relationships, skills, and ideas you’ve developed can continue to grow. Taking time to reflect, share, and plan next steps will help you maximise the long-term impact of your experience.

* Capture and share your outcomes
    * Summarise the project in a clear, accessible way — what was achieved, what challenges were overcome, and what was learned.
    * Document your experience soon after the placement ends, while details are fresh. This could be a written report, presentation, blog post, or even a short video. 
    * Include any outputs or resources created (e.g. code, documentation, training materials) and ensure they are stored in a place that is accessible to collaborators and, where possible, the wider DRI community.
* Book follow-up meetings before the placement ends to keep conversations going. This could be monthly, quarterly, or aligned to specific project milestones.
* Stay in touch through email, calls, or virtual check-ins, and keep sharing relevant opportunities, resources, or updates.
* Plan for the future:
    * Explore funding opportunities to continue or expand your work, including collaborative grants, institutional support, or other CAKE initiatives.
    * Consider whether you could co-author publications, present together at conferences, or co-deliver training to extend the reach of your collaboration.

## In conclusion
A placement or visit can be a fantastic opportunity to explore ideas you care about, exchange knowledge, and lay the foundations for collaborations that can grow long after the funding period ends!
