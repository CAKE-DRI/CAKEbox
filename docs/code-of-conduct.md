Overview: 
----------
The Computational Abilities Knowledge Exchange (CAKE) Network+ is dedicated to providing a sense of community within the Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) programme and the UK’s wider large-scale computing community. Outward facing and keen to attract new communities, this network is a central hub that brings projects together to enable them to share their successes, achievements and explore how to most effectively work together and leverage each other’s work.

A central part of this is building an inclusive, welcoming and safe environment for everyone, regardless of sex, age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and parenthood, race, religion or belief (or lack thereof), gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, technical choices, experience level or any other dimension of diversity. 

Everyone deserves an experience free from harassment, where they are treated with respect and kindness. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.

Through engaging with our community and becoming a CAKE Network+ member, you are agreeing to this Code of Conduct. All CAKE Network+ members are required to conform to this Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved.

Expected Behaviour: 
------------------
In order to foster a positive and professional environment we encourage the following behaviours:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Unacceptable Behaviour:
-----------------------
Examples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to:

* Harassment of any form, including offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or technical choices.
* Displaying sexual images or materials in public spaces.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
* Harassing photography or recording without consent.
* Sustained disruption of talks, workshops, or other events.
* Inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome sexual attention.
* Behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort.
* Use of derogatory or offensive language, including swearing or inappropriate jokes.

Please be mindful that different people can experience language and actions differently; we encourage everyone to think carefully about their words and actions.


Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour: 
---------------------------------------
Anyone asked to cease unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately. If a CAKE Network+ member engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, the CAKE Steering Committee may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion and ban from the CAKE Network+.
