View the documentation locally:
You can view CAKEbox locally to test changes before submitting them to review - perfect for catching small typos and mistakes before they go live.

First, you need to get the code:

Create a GitHub account.
Fork the CAKEbox repository and clone it locally.
Create a new branch for your changes.
Next, install mkdocs, build the documentation and launch a local server:

pip install mkdocs
mkdocs serve
View in your local browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

You can now make changes live and edits will instantly appear in your local version - a bit like a sandbox.

Once you are happy, commit changes and open a pull request.
