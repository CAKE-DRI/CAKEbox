### **CONNECT DRI:  Community of Practice for leaders of UKRI DRI facilities and services**

CONNECT DRI’s objective is to establish and develop a community of practice (CoP) for leaders responsible for grant funded DRI facilities and services who are navigating the rapidly evolving DRI landscape. It brings together leaders across different facility types (e.g. data and/or compute) and disciplines. The CoP is focused on developing good practice regarding: 1) Approaches to inform the design, development and operations of DRI facilities and services, and 2) Approaches to maximise use and impact. The CoP will be delivered via a mixture of in person and online activities which will enable members to share their experience, lessons learned, hear from invited speakers and to develop good practice. It will foster new relationships and develop the network of UKRI DRI  leaders.
