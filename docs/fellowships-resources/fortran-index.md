### **Fortran index: Facilitating better knowledge exchange within the Fortran community**

Many high quality learning resources and tools have been developed for the Fortran programming language over its seven decades of usage. However, their visibility is generally poor in the community. This fellowship builds on the work of the Fortran index hackathon series to facilitate better sharing of knowledge by adding to, correcting, and curating the information presented in the fortran-lang community resource.
