### **Basic introductions for the DRI community to the benefits and processes of Kubernetes**

This fellowship aims to introduce members of the DRI community to the container orchestration platform Kubernetes (K8s). This platform is widely used throughout industry but has not been utilised as much across academia. Although not a one size fits all solution for research infrastructure, I am hoping to break the ice into the K8s world for RSEs, enable them to feel comfortable experimenting with the platform, and bring relevant members of the community together to encourage shared resources and reduced duplication of effort.
